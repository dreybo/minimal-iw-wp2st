								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>«Krivatch 61» is the new symbol of the national pride, it is strong, robust, masculine, tasty, rich in bread aroma, attractive and truly Russian premium distillate.<br />
Today «Krivatch 61» is the most special and provocative strong alcohol drink in Russia. It was born to surprise by its strength of 61% vol., unbeaten bread taste and aroma, the top quality and innovative bottle design.<br />
«Krivatch 61» is not a vodka, but a meticulously reconstructed home-born Russian rye malt distillate that so far has never been sold neither in Russia nor elsewhere in the world. «Krivatch 61» makes a real revolution in the Russian alcohol market and starts a new period in Russian national alcohol production by setting a new level of quality and taste. To achieve its distinct flavor, it is processed in alembics, originally reconstructed copper pot stills and is purified with egg white and birch charcoal. It is produced in the old distillery. Today this forgotten technology is absolutely innovative for Russian alcohol production.</p>
<p>Aroma: cool grain notes and bright aroma of warm home baking, notes of red apple, yellow plum and meadow grasses.</p>
<p>Taste: powerful, masculine, warming, with notes of hot rye bread crust, crackers and saturated bread tone.</p>
<p>Aftertaste: with notes of grain, hot rye bread, meadow and field grasses, warm home baking.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rye Malt Polugar is the apex of the classical Russian distillation art, the true masterpiece of the bread taste and aroma created by Boris Rodionov in copper stills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rye Malt Polugar has an intense cream texture, unmatched soft and complex taste of freshly baked rye bread and long lasting, warming and slowly disappearing aftertaste. Unrivalled softness and deep taste of this bread wine is achieved by adhering to the traditional technologies and month-long ‘maturing’ of Rye Malt Polugar when noble distillates mix, slowly forming their unique saturated bread flavour that is so close and familiar for every Russian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Single Malt Rye Polugar is bottled in the finest glass bottle, which is a reconstructed copy of the Queen Elizabeth personal stoff-bottle dated 1745, located in the Russian National Museum.</p>
<p>Aroma: bright, bready, aroma of warm home-baked goods, rye crackers, coriander, malt, honey, grains, new grasses and wildflowers; slight sweetness.</p>
<p>Taste: mild taste of fresh rye bread, linden honey, meadow grasses and grains; slight rye bitterness.</p>
<p>Aftertaste: very prolonged, gradually trailing off, warm, warming, with bright notes of rye bread, honey, sweet almonds and wildflowers.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The technology of Polugar №2 Garlic and Pepper is fully consistent with the 19th-century recipe, where garlic and pepper were infused with the traditional Russian Polugar standard grain distillate. When this technology is used, natural essential oils from the garlic and pepper are gently transferred to the grain distillate of rye and wheat, while retaining their original intense aroma and unique burning taste.</p>
<p>Aroma: bright aroma of baked garlic and hot pepper.</p>
<p>Taste: warming and saturated taste of baked garlic, warm taste of hot pepper, wheat and rye bread.</p>
<p>Aftertaste: prolonged aftertaste with notes of garlic, spices and lard and with slight nuances of grains and bread.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<div style="color: #000000;">Type: Bread wine.
Origin: Poland.
Triple distilled rye &#38; wheat grains.
Alcohol: 38.5%.
Volume: 500 ml.</div>]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polugar №1 is a revived historic Russian bread wine — the progenitor of modern vodka. The production of Polugar №1 was stopped in 1895. In the Russian Empire, bread wine was the name for a grain distillate, which was a strong alcoholic drink produced by means of distillation in copper pot stills.  At the time, rectification of pure ethyl spirit had not yet been invented, and this drink carefully preserved the flavour and aroma of its raw materials – rye and wheat.</p>
<p>Aroma: bready aroma of home baking.</p>
<p>Taste: delicate, slightly sweetish, warming soft taste of rye and wheat bread, crackers and bread crust with bread-honey notes.</p>
<p>Aftertaste: long-lasting, dominated by hints of wheat bread, with notes of grains, meadow grasses, warm home baking, fresh hay and warm bread crumb.</p>
